\section intro_sec Introduction

The CellML Application Programming Interface (CellML API) provides an interface that applications can use to manipulate and process CellML documents. The interfaces are designed to be independent of any programming language, platform, or vendor, and are expressed in the OMG Interface Definition Language (IDL). It addresses both CellML 1.0 and CellML 1.1.

The CellML API comes with a complete, Free / Open Source implementation, and this implementation can be used by programs from C++, Java, and Python.
